The designed training and validation dataset for default pattern are provided in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l5uVTfmdz1kfLMG2TA8B3wblZNqMUlng/view?usp=sharing. It takes 1.93GB and I dont have enough space for the alternative pattern. 

This may be the last code I upload as open-source contributor. A interview to Wireless Network Laboratory @ Huawei Wireless Product Line, shanghai made me feel very annoying, so no more code for generalization research. GL guys

可能这是上传的最后一个代码了，因为无线产品线下属无线网络实验室的面试/聊天给我整挺恶心的，GL。和Noah和Hisilicon接触的更早，但是被恶心了一下lol。

Please feel free to test and use this training dataset which could achieve robust generalization.
