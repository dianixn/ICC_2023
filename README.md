Code for Achieving Robust Generalization for Wireless Channel Estimation Neural Networks by Designed Training Data

The designed training and validation dataset for default pattern are provided in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l5uVTfmdz1kfLMG2TA8B3wblZNqMUlng/view?usp=sharing. It takes 1.93GB and I dont have enough space for the alternative pattern. Email me for it. 

Please feel free to test and use this training dataset which could achieve robust generalization.
